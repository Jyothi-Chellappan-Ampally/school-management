Tech Lab School's story began in the most humble of settings—Sal Tech's living room in Mountain View, California. In 2014, armed with just a PowerPoint presentation and a vision for reimagining education, Sal shared his ideas with a small group of passionate parents who believed in the possibility of a different kind of school. From that first living room meeting, a committed community formed around the ambitious goal of creating a learning environment that would break free from traditional educational constraints.
Starting with just 30 students in a single mixed-age classroom, the school became a reality, growing from Sal's vision to reimagine education for the 21st century. Inspired by the success of Tech Academy's online platform, Sal and these founding families recognized the need for a physical school that could serve as a laboratory for educational innovation. The school's founding principles emphasized mastery-based learning, student agency, and real-world application of knowledge—moving beyond traditional grade levels and fixed academic schedules.

Today, Tech Lab School continues to evolve and grow while maintaining its commitment to being a model for educational innovation, serving as both a successful independent school and an incubator for new teaching and learning practices.
